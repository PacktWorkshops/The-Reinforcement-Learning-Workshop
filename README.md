## About The Reinforcement Learning Workshop
With the help of practical examples and engaging activities, [The Reinforcement Learning Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Workshop-cutting-edge-reinforcement-dp-1800200455/dp/1800200455/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1611062513&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800200456&utm_term=Reinforcement%20Learning&utm_content=The%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Workshop) takes you through reinforcement learningâ€™s core techniques and frameworks. Following a hands-on approach, it allows you to learn reinforcement learning at your own pace to develop your own intelligent applications with ease.

## What you will learn
* Use OpenAI Gym as a framework to implement RL environments
* Find out how to define and implement reward function
* Explore Markov chain, Markov decision process, and the Bellman equation
* Distinguish between Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, and Temporal Difference Learning
* Understand the multi-armed bandit problem and explore various strategies to solve it
* Build a deep Q model network for playing the video game Breakout
